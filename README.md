IOT on a website for my new house!
Uses johnny five + etherport for wifi arduinos, angular9/ionic5 for the front end, express api to ping the arduino when pinged by the front end

api/howto.txt for more info on doing it yourself!

Also has a neato little pdf form filler thing i did for a buddy, and some scrap api/ionic stuff from workshops i gave at HackGSU.
